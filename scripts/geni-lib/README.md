# Getting CloudLab Credentials

1. Go to https://www.cloudlab.us/
2. Login with your cloudlab account
3. On the top right corner, click on your username, and then click on "Download Credentials"
4. This will take you to a page with a button to download the credentials. Click on it.
5. This will download a file called `cloudlab.pem`.

The `cloudlab.pem` contains the encrypted private key to your cloudlab account and ssl certificate. You need to decrypt it before using it.

## Install OpenSSL (if not already installed)

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install openssl
```

For macOS:
```bash
brew install openssl
```

## Decrypt the CloudLab credentials

```bash
openssl rsa -in cloudlab.pem -out cloudlab_decrypted.pem
```

When prompted for a password, enter your CloudLab account password (the same one you use to login to the CloudLab website).
This will create a new file `cloudlab_decrypted.pem` containing your decrypted private key.
The SSL certificate remains in the original `cloudlab.pem` file.

# Fixing the geni-lib library

The `geni-lib` is outdated and some parts of the code are not compatible with python 3.12.
Before proceeding, ensure you have:
1. Created and activated a Python virtual environment
2. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
3. Installed `lib2to3` using the following command if not already installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-lib2to3
```

Then run the fix script:
```bash
cd scripts/geni-lib
./fix_geni_lib.sh
```

# Building a context definition for CloudLab

To build a context definition, you'll need:
- Your CloudLab certificate (`cloudlab.pem`)
- Your decrypted private key (`cloudlab_decrypted.pem`)
- Your SSH public key
- Your project name (use lowercase to avoid Slice URN conflicts)

Use the following command format:
```bash
build-context --type cloudlab --cert <path_to_cert> --pubkey <path_to_pubkey> --project <project_name>
```

Example:
```bash
build-context --type cloudlab --cert cloudlab.pem --key cloudlab_decrypted.pem --pubkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --project aiopslab
```

# How GENI Works

GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) and CloudLab use two core concepts for managing experimental resources:

## Understanding Slices and Slivers

### Slice
- A slice is a logical container that groups resources (nodes, links) for a specific experiment
- Think of it as a virtual workspace for organizing resources
- Has an expiration time that can be renewed

### Sliver
- A sliver is a specific allocated resource (node, link, VM) within a slice
- Each sliver exists at a particular physical site (aggregate)
- Examples: A compute node at Wisconsin CloudLab
- Slivers include details like:
  - Node specifications (e.g., c220g5)
  - IP addresses (public and private)
  - SSH access information
- Sliver expiration time cannot exceed its parent slice's expiration time

## Understanding RSpec Files

RSpec files are used to define the resources and their configurations for a slice. We can get them two ways:
1. We can modify the `generate_rspec.py` script to programmatically define our resources and generate the RSpec file corresponding to our resources.
2. We can simply go to cloudlab and copy the rspec of a profile we want to use. Store the rspec files in the `scripts/geni-lib/rspecs` directory.

## Using the GENI Manager

The `genictl.py` script provides an interactive CLI to manage both slices and slivers.

### Interactive Mode

To enter interactive mode:
```bash
cd scripts/geni-lib
python genictl.py
```

### Available Commands

1. **create-slice**
   - Creates a new slice container for your experiment
   ```bash
   > create-slice
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   Enter expiration time (hours from now, default 1): 2
   Enter slice description (default "CloudLab experiment"): My distributed experiment
   ```

2. **create-sliver**
   - Allocates resources in a specific site
   - Saves login information to `<slice_name>.login.info.txt`
   ```bash
   > create-sliver
   Enter site (utah, clemson, wisconsin): utah
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   Enter path to RSpec file: rspecs/test.xml
   ```

3. **sliver-status**
   - Checks the current status of allocated resources
   ```bash
   > sliver-status
   Enter site (utah, clemson, wisconsin): utah
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   ```

4. **renew-slice**
   - Extends the expiration time of a slice
   ```bash
   > renew-slice
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   Enter new expiration time (hours from now, default 1): 3
   ```

5. **renew-sliver**
   - Extends the expiration time of resources at a specific site
   - Note: Set sliver expiration slightly less than slice expiration (e.g., 2.9h instead of 3h) to account for command execution delays
   ```bash
   > renew-sliver
   Enter site (utah, clemson, wisconsin): utah
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   Enter new expiration time (hours from now, default 1): 2.9
   ```

6. **list-slices**
   - Shows all active slices and their details
   ```bash
   > list-slices
   Output in JSON format? (y/n): n
   ```

7. **sliver-spec**
   - Shows detailed specifications of allocated resources
   - Includes node specs, IP addresses, and network info
   ```bash
   > sliver-spec
   Enter site (utah, clemson, wisconsin): utah
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   ```

8. **delete-sliver**
   - Removes allocated resources from a slice
   ```bash
   > delete-sliver
   Enter site (utah, clemson, wisconsin): utah
   Enter slice name: test-slice
   ```
